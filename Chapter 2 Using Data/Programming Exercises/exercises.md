# Programming Exercises
## Question 1
What is the numeric value of each of the following expressions as evaluated
by Java?

1a. 4 + 6 * 2 = 16

1b. 10 / 5 + 8 = 10

1c. 12 / 4 + 16 / 2 = 10

1d. 17 / 2 = 8

1e. 22 / 5 = 4

1f. 39 / 10 = 3

1g. 19 % (2 + 3) = 4

1h. 3 + 4 * 20 / 3 = 29

1i. 36 % (6 + 2)) = 4

1j. 8 % 2 * 0 = 0

## Question 2
What is the value of each of the following Boolean expressions?

2a. 15 > 13 = true

2b. 8 <= (2 + 6) = true

2c. 5 == 15 = false

2d. 3 >= 3 = true

2e. 3 * 3 == 2 * 4 = false

2f. 5 < 8 â€“ 3 = false

2g. 7 != 7 = false

2h. 8 != (2 + 5) = true

2i. 10 â€“ 20 == -10 = true

2j. 3 + 2 * 6 == 15 = true

## Question 3
Choose the best data type for each of the following so that any reasonable value
is accommodated but no memory storage is wasted. Give an example of a typical
value that would be held by the variable, and explain why you chose the type
you did.

3a. int

3b. double

3c. int

3d. int

3e. int

3f. int

3g. int

3h. int

3i. byte

3j. double
